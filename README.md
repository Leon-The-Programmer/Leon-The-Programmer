### `Prospective Software Engineer`

#
Hi, I am Subhanshu and Leon is my english name. The latter is much easier to say and remember.

I am currently seeking a software engineer role in a FinTech or an HFT.
To express an immeasurable interest to work in the field of finance, I've independently engineered a Crypto Trading Platform â€” Subcryption.
